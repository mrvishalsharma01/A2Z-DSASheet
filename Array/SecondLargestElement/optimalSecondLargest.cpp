//  Optimal Approach
// In the better we are doing 2 pass traversal but here we need to do in single traversal 
// Now here if the current element is larger than update the second largest and large variable 
// Else if the current elemt is largest than second largest than we will updte the variable second large 

// Time Complexity:- o(n)
// space complexity:-  o(1)
